- [x] Set up environment variables (`.env` file).

### Refinement & Testing
- [x] Refine contracts (e.g., add `SafeERC20`, improve error handling, add events).
- [x] Write unit tests for `TicketNFT.sol`.
- [x] Write unit tests for `EventRegistry.sol`.
- [x] Write unit tests for `PaymentHandler.sol`.
- [x] Write integration tests.

- [x] Transfer ownership of `TicketNFT` contract to the deployed `PaymentHandler` address.
- [x] Verify contracts on Basescan.

## Frontend Development Tasks

### Project Setup
- [x] Initialize Next.js project in `/frontend` with App Router and Tailwind CSS.
  - Run `npx create-next-app@latest frontend --js --tailwind --app`.
  - Selected **Yes** to use a `src/` directory for project files.
  - Selected **Yes** to use Turbopack for `next dev`.
  - Selected **Yes** to customize the import alias, set to `@eventpass/*`.
  - **Status**: Completed - Project initialized with `src/`, Turbopack enabled, and import alias `@eventpass/*`.
- [x] Install frontend dependencies. // Updated this line
  - Run `cd frontend && npm install wagmi @coinbase/onchainkit @neynar/minikit @coinbase/coinbase-sdk`. // Corrected package name
  - **Status**: Completed (wagmi, onchainkit, coinbase-sdk installed). `@neynar/minikit` failed (404 Not Found) - will address later.
- [x] Configure wagmi for Base Sepolia (chain ID 84532) in `/frontend/src/utils/wagmi.js`.
  - Include `PaymentHandler` and `EventRegistry` contract ABIs and addresses.
  - Added MetaMask (`injected`) connector.
- [x] Set up project structure (using App Router). // Updated this section
  - Landing page: `/frontend/src/app/page.js` (exists).
  - Event details page: `/frontend/src/app/event/[eventId]/page.js` (created).
  - Minting confirmation page: `/frontend/src/app/mint/page.js` (created).
  - Wallet connection component: `/frontend/src/components/WalletConnect.js` (created).
  - Pricing utility: `/frontend/src/utils/pricing.js` (created).
  - **Status**: Completed - Directories and empty files created for App Router structure.

### Core Functionality
- [x] Build landing page in `/frontend/src/app/page.js`. // Updated path
  - Displays events fetched from `EventRegistry.sol`.
  - Shows "Create New Event" button for admin/owner.
  - Handles loading and error states for event fetching.
  - Styled with Tailwind CSS.
  - ~~Display a welcome message and options for wallet creation and USDC purchase.~~ (Deferred/Replaced by current functionality)
  - ~~Add a "Get Started" button to redirect to `/event/[eventId]` (e.g., `/event/1` for testing).~~ (Replaced by event cards linking to detail pages)
- [ ] Integrate CDP Wallet API for new user wallet creation on the landing page.
  - Add a "Create Wallet" button in `/frontend/src/app/page.js` for users without wallets. // Updated path
  - Use Wallet API to generate a smart wallet for new users.
  - Display the new wallet address upon creation.
- [ ] Integrate CDP Onramp for fiat-to-USDC purchases on the landing page.
  - Add an Onramp UI component to `/frontend/src/app/page.js`. // Updated path
  - Allow users to buy USDC with fiat before proceeding to the event page.
- [x] Implement wallet connection component in `/frontend/src/components/WalletConnect.js`.
  - Use OnchainKit to connect to Base Sepolia.
  - Display connected wallet address and disconnect option.
  - Make the component globally accessible via `/frontend/src/app/layout.js`. // Updated path for App Router global layout
  - **Note**: We've been using wagmi's `useAccount` and OnchainKit's connect button, which covers this.
- [x] Build event details page in `/frontend/src/app/event/[eventId]/page.js`. // Updated path
  - Fetches event data (name, date, price, tickets available) from `EventRegistry.sol` using `getEventDetails`.
  - Displays event details in a card with Tailwind CSS.
  - Implemented "Buy Now" button that triggers USDC payment and automatic NFT minting.
- [x] Implement USDC payment and automatic NFT minting flow on `/frontend/src/app/event/[eventId]/page.js`.
  - Uses wagmi to call `USDC.approve` for the ticket price (to `PaymentHandler.sol`).
  - Calls `PaymentHandler.purchaseTicket` (or equivalent) to process payment and mint NFT in a single transaction.
  - On success, displays confirmation (e.g., redirect to `/mint` page or show inline message).
  - Handles errors (e.g., insufficient USDC, sold-out event) with user-friendly messages.
- [ ] Build minting confirmation page in `/frontend/src/app/mint/page.js`. // Updated path
  - Display the already-minted NFT’s metadata (event ID, name, date).
  - Add a "Share on Warpcast" button using MiniKit.
  - Style with Tailwind CSS (dark theme, 21st.dev-inspired design).
- [x] Implement "Create New Event" page (`/frontend/src/app/create-event/page.js`) accessible by admin.
  - Form for event details (name, price, max supply).
  - Calls `createEvent` on `EventRegistry.sol`.
  - Admin status verified by checking `owner()` of `EventRegistry.sol` against connected address.
- [ ] Write Jest tests for frontend components.
  - Test `app/page.js` for rendering and navigation. // Updated path
  - Test `WalletConnect.js` for connection/disconnection.
  - Test `app/event/[eventId]/page.js` for rendering and payment/minting flow. // Updated path
  - Test `app/mint/page.js` for NFT display and Warpcast sharing. // Updated path

### Advanced Features & CDP Integrations
- [ ] Integrate CDP AgentKit for AI-driven dynamic pricing.
  - Use AgentKit API in `/frontend/src/utils/pricing.js` to suggest ticket prices based on demand (e.g., tickets sold).
  - Display suggested price on the event page (e.g., "Price may increase soon: $10").
- [ ] Integrate CDP Pricing API for real-time USDC/USD prices.
  - Fetch USDC/USD price in `/frontend/src/utils/pricing.js`.
  - Display ticket price in USD alongside USDC on the event page (e.g., "10 USDC ($10.00)").
- [ ] Integrate CDP OnchainKit for enhanced wallet interactions.
  - Already used for wallet connection; ensure compatibility with Base Sepolia.
  - Add balance display (USDC balance) in `WalletConnect.js` using OnchainKit utilities.
- [ ] Explore CDP Staking API integration.
  - If applicable, allow users to stake USDC earned from referrals (if a referral system is added).
  - Alternatively, document Staking API as a future feature for organizers to stake event earnings.
- [ ] Integrate CDP Paymaster for gasless transactions.
  - Modify `PaymentHandler.sol` to support Paymaster-sponsored transactions.
  - Redeploy and verify updated contract on Base Sepolia.
  - Update frontend to handle gasless transactions.
- [ ] Write Jest tests for CDP integrations.
  - Test AgentKit price suggestions.
  - Test Pricing API price display.
  - Test OnchainKit balance display.
  - Test Paymaster gasless transactions.

### Deployment
- [ ] Deploy frontend to Vercel.
  - Run `vercel deploy` in `/frontend`.
- [ ] Test QR code flow with backend and contracts.
  - Ensure QR code redirects to `/event/[eventId]`.
  - Verify wallet connection, payment, minting, and navigation to `/mint`.
- [ ] Document deployed frontend URL.
  - Add to `/docs/deployment.md`.
